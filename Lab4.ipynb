    "\n",
    "- French: geopolitical entity\n",
    "- Morocco: geographic entity \n",
    "- Christmas: time indicator\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything else that is labeled with an `O` is not considered to be a named entity. In this assignment, you will train a named entity recognition system that could be trained in a few seconds (on a GPU) and will get around 75% accuracy. Then, you will load in the exact version of your model, which was trained for a longer period of time. You could then evaluate the trained version of your model to get 96% accuracy! Finally, you will be able to test your named entity recognition system with your own sentence."

    "\n",
    "**Instructions:** Implement a dataset class that takes in ` x, y, pad ` where $x$ is a large list of sentences, and $y$ is a list of the tags associated with those sentences and pad is a pad value. This class you need to implement \n",
    "\n",
    "`__init__ function to initiate the sentences, labels and mask for the entire dataset`\n",
    "\n",
    "`__getitem__ function will take in index and return the coresponding sentence , label , mask`\n",
    "\n",
    "`__len__ return the size of the dataset`\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "`X` and `Y` are arrays of dimension (`batch_size, max_len`), where `max_len` is the length of the longest sentence *in that batch*. You will pad the `X` and `Y` examples with the pad argument. If `shuffle=True`, the data will be traversed in a random order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Details:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this code as an outer loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "while True:  \n",
    "...  \n",
    "yield((X,Y))  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "so your data generator runs continuously. Within that loop, define two `for` loops:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first stores temporal lists of the data samples to be included in the batch, and finds the maximum length of the sentences contained in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second one moves the elements from the temporal list into NumPy arrays pre-filled with pad values.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three features useful for defining this generator:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The NumPy `full` function to fill the NumPy arrays with a pad value. See [full function documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/1.18/reference/generated/numpy.full.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tracking the current location in the incoming lists of sentences. Generators variables hold their values between invocations, so we create an `index` variable, initialize to zero, and increment by one for each sample included in a batch. However, we do not use the `index` to access the positions of the list of sentences directly. Instead, we use it to select one index from a list of indexes. In this way, we can change the order in which we traverse our original list, keeping untouched our original list.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Since `batch_size` and the length of the input lists are not aligned, gathering a batch_size group of inputs may involve wrapping back to the beginning of the input loop. In our approach, it is just enough to reset the `index` to 0. We can re-shuffle the list of indexes to produce different batches each time."
